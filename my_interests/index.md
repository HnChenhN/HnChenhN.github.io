I have a board range of interests and have so many insights in many fields.

## Music

- I started learning piano when I was five. And I passed the Provincial Level 10 exam in my second year of my junior high school. Although in my opinion now, Provincial Level 10 is nothing. I have a thought that learned piano affected my music taste.

- I enjoy several music styles, such as symphonic metal, classical piano and music with niche melodyies.
 Take symphonic metal, one of my favorite bands is *NightWish*, a Finnish band.
 I think their composer(*Tuomas Holopainen, /ˈtuːomas hoʊˈloʊpaɪnɛn/*) is incredibly talented.
 However in this society I live in, most people don't understand this kind of music.
 Their lead singer has changed twice, and I really like the first(*Tarja Turunen, /ˈtɑr.jɑ ˈturunen/*) one.
 Her voice is very powerful and penetrating to me

- Regarding classical music, I prefer Chopin(*ˈfrɛdɛrik ˈʂɔpæn/*), a Polish composer.
 Whether it's nocturnes, études or waltzes, they all sound great.

- As for pop music, but not the mainstream kind, I really like *Lana Del Rey (ˈlɑːnə dɛl reɪ/)*.
 Some of her songs really resonate with me, especially *Off to the Races* and a few tracks from her album *Norman Fucking Rockwell! (NFR)*.

- Generally, I've found that I prefer music in minor keys, and I feel this may be related to my personality.
 Mostly, I don't usually talk much; I prefer staying alone and reflecting on something.
 I think this aligns with people's personality traits.
 Take the MBTI, proposed by the psychologist *Carl Gustav Jung (/kɑːrl ˈɡʊstɑːv jʊŋ/)*, which includes a dimension that reflects a person's level of introversion.
 When someone is more introveted, they are typically categorized as *I*, while the more extroveted are labeled as *E*.
 I belive most introverts may prefer music in minor keys, but this conclusion is purely based on my intuition, and I don't have any concrete evidence to support it.
