I have a board range of interests and have so many insights in many fields.

## Music

- I started learning piano when I was five. And I passed the Provincial Level 10 exam in my second year of my junior high school. Although in my opinion now, Provincial Level 10 is nothing. I have a thought that learned piano affected my music taste.

- I enjoy several music styles, such as symphonic metal, classical piano and music with niche melodyies. Take symphonic metal, one of my favorite band is *NightWish*, a Finnish band. I think their composer(*Tuomas Holopainen, /ˈtuːomas hoʊˈloʊpaɪnɛn/*) is very talented. But in this society I live in, most people don't understand it. Their lead singer has changed twice, and I really like the first(*Tarja Turunen, /ˈtɑr.jɑ ˈturunen/*) one. Her voice is very powerful and penetrating.
- Regarding classical music, I prefer Chopin(*ˈfrɛdɛrik ˈʂɔpæn/*), a Polish composer. Whether it's nocturnes, études or waltzes, they all sound great.
- As for pop music, but not so pop, I really like *Lana Del Rey (ˈlɑːnə dɛl reɪ/)*. Some of her songs really hit my soul straightly, especially *off to the races* and a part of the album called *NFR (Norman Fucking Rockwell!)*.
- Generally, I found that I prefer the music in minor keys. I feel this may be related to my personality. Mostly, I don't talk too much, I prefer staying alone and thinking about things. I think this  aligns with people's personality traits. Take MBTI, which was propose by a psychologist *Carl Gustav Jung (/kɑːrl ˈɡʊstɑːv jʊŋ/)*, there is a dimension reflects a person's introversive extent. When a person is more introvetive, then the value on the dimension is *I*, otherwise, is *E*. I think most I person are prefer the minor keys tune, but this conclusion just come from my intuition, and I don't have any factual prove about it.
